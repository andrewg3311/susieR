\title{Applies susie to perform trend filtering (especially
  changepoint problems), a type of non-parametric regression.}
\usage{
susie_trendfilter(y, order = 0, standardize = FALSE, use_mad = TRUE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{an n vector of observations that are ordered in time or
space (assumed equally-spaced)}

\item{order}{an integer specifying the order of trend filtering. Default order=0, which corresponds
to "changepoint" problems (i.e. piecewise constant mu). Although order > 0 is implemented, we do not recommend using it since we
find there are often problems with convergence of the algorithm to poor local optima, producing unreliable inferences.}

\item{standardize}{boolean indicating whether to standardize X variables (basis functions); defaults to FALSE as these basis functions already have a natural scale}

\item{use_mad}{boolean indicating whether to use ``median absolute deviation" (MAD) method to estimate residual variance.
If TRUE then susie is run twice,
first by fixing the residual variance to the MAD value and then a second time, initializing from the first fit,
but with residual variance estimated the usual way (maximizing the ELBO). We have found this strategy
typically improves reliability of results by reducing a tendency to converge to poor local optima of the ELBO.}

\item{...}{other parameters to pass to susie}
}
\value{
a "susie" object; see ?susie for details

\description{
Applies susie to perform trend filtering (especially
  changepoint problems), a type of non-parametric regression.
}
\details{
Fits the non-parametric Gaussian regression model $y=mu
+e$, where the mean $mu$ is modelled as $mu=Xb$ where $X$ is a
matrix with columns containing an appropriate basis and b is vector
with a (sparse) SuSiE prior. In particular, when order=0, the $j$th
column of $X$ is a vector with first $j$ elements equal to 0 and
remaining elements equal to 1, so b_j corresponds to the change in
the mean of y between indices $j$ and $j+1$.  For background on
trend filtering see [Adaptive piecewise polynomial estimation via
trend
filtering](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1395234979)(Ryan
J. Tibshirani, 2014) The implementation here exploits the special
structure of $X$ whiuch means that the matrix-vector product $X'y$
is fast to compute in O(n) computation rather than $O(n^2)$ if $X$
were formed explicitly. For implementation details, view the
"trendfiltering derivations" vignette by running
\code{vignette("trendfiltering_derivations")}.

mu = c(rep(0,50),rep(1,50),rep(3,50),rep(-2,50),rep(0,300))
y = mu + rnorm(500)

susie_get_cs(s) # returns credible sets (for indices of y that occur just before changepoints)
susie_plot_changepoint(s,y) # produces ggplot with credible sets for changepoints on top of plot
