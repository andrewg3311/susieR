Title: Fit Sum of Single Effects Linear Regression Model 
Description: The package implements a simple new way to perform
    variable selection in multiple regression ($y=Xb+e$), using
    computationally efficient variational Bayes approach. The methods
    implemented here are particularly well-suited to settings where
    some of the X variables are highly correlated, and the true
    effects are highly sparse (e.g. <20 non-zero effects in the vector
    $b$), although it is also useful to more general applications.
